KeyViz is a lightweight and accessible application designed to help users track key presses and Caps Lock status in real-time. Whether you're testing a keyboard with missing or malfunctioning keys, navigating a keyboard with limited visibility, or simply needing an easy way to monitor Caps Lock, KeyViz offers a straightforward solution. This tool is especially useful for individuals with visual impairments, those with hardware issues, or anyone needing to verify keyboard functionality.

KeyViz provides a real-time display of every keystroke, ensuring users can see exactly what is being pressed. This makes it a valuable resource for both casual users and those performing more specialized keyboard testing. Its simple and intuitive interface allows for quick setup, eliminating complexity while maintaining accessibility.
